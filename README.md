<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Ruby Blog web app <a name="about-project"></a>

**Ruby Blog web apps** is a project implementing a blogging platform with four interconnected tables: Comment, User, Post, and Like. Users can create posts, comment on posts, and like posts. Each entity has attributes such as name, photo, bio, title, text, and counters for comments and likes. Associations between models are established, allowing easy retrieval of related data. The project includes custom methods to retrieve recent comments and update counters. Built using the power of Rails framework to enable efficient CRUD operations and seamless interaction with the database.
